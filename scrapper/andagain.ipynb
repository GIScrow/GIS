We always judge a sushi restaurant by the quality of their salmon roe nigiri, and we're happy to say that theirs is off-the-charts delish! The sake selection is impressive and very tasty, and what better way to wash down a stellar meal of sushi and sashimi than that? Love it!\\n</p>, <h5>\\nRed Robin\\n</h5>, <p>\\n27193 185th Avenue SE, \\nCovington, WA 98042\\n</p>, <p>\\nPhone number (253) 630-5441\\n</p>, <p>\\nRed Robin is another chain that we really like. Enough Party Bus Seattle groups in the Covington area have chosen this one as their dining destination that we had to perk up and take notice! They've got really tasty burgers that are juicy and perfectly cooked to order. The array of specialty burgers is always impressive and they're always offering new seasonal specialties to keep things fresh. If you're not a burger lover, they have fantastic entrees and salads too, and even mouth watering milkshakes! We recommend the mint brownie. Mmm!\\n</p>, <h5>\\nNikki's Restaurant &amp; Lounge\\n</h5>, <p>\\n27120 174th Pl SE, \\nCovington, WA 98042\\n</p>, <p>\\n(253) 236-5623\\n</p>, <p>\\nNikki's Restaurant &amp; Lounge is a cozy diner and bar that is well known to our Party Bus Seattle partygoers in the Covington vicinity. They offer a full bar and even televisions so that you can keep an eye on the game while you nosh and chat with your friends. It's not fancy here, just simple and good, with nice happy hour prices that will really put a smile on your face. If you've got a sweet tooth, don't shy away from their homemade cinnamon rolls. If you're there for breakfast, they've got scrambles that will really please your tastebuds.\\n</p>, <h5>\\nMizu Japanese Steak House\\n</h5>, <p>\\n27149 185th Ave SE, \\nCovington, WA 98042\\n</p>, <p>\\n(253) 638-1317\\n</p>, <p>\\nMizu Japanese Steak House is a sushi bar and seafood/steakhouse style restaurant that will entice your tastebuds to no end. If you love teppanyaki style cooking, you'll really enjoy the entertainment that comes along with that, and the quality of the food is undeniable. Their fried rice is some of the best that we have ever tasted. The space is large and they have lots of windows to let the light in. There is a full bar here, not just sake, so you can enjoy whatever drink your little heart is in the mood for. Free wi-fi and televisions as well! Very nice.\\n</p>, <h5>\\nPuerto Vallarta\\n</h5>, <p>\\n16717 SE 272nd St, \\nCovington, WA 98042\\n</p>, <p>\\n(253) 631-1399\\n</p>, <p>\\nPuerto Vallarta is a sensational Mexican restaurant that even offers an impressive buffet. The prices here are in the affordable range and the quality is super high. The chimichanga special is truly mouth watering and we cannot get enough of their famous tortilla soup. Their carne asada is another amazing choice that we'd recommend any day of the week! There is a full bar as well as televisions for watching sports, and though they close up at 11:30 most nights, they are open until 1:30 am on Fridays and Saturdays. A great weekend destination!\\n</p>]\n",
